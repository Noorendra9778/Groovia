# 🌱 Groovia - The Eco-Friendly Browser

**Groovia** is a smart, minimalist web browser that helps save the planet — one search at a time. Every time you search with Groovia, you're redirected to eco-conscious engines like **Ecosia**, **OceanHero**, and **GiveWater**, supporting causes such as tree planting, ocean cleanup, and clean water access.

## 🌍 Why Groovia?

Because the web doesn’t have to cost the Earth.

Groovia makes it effortless to do good while you browse:
- 🌳 **Plant Trees** with Ecosia  
- 💧 **Give Water** through GiveWater  
- 🌊 **Clean Oceans** with OceanHero  
- 🔁 All from one seamless, simple interface

And the best part?  
**Why stick to just one eco-browser when you can do more?**  
Groovia’s **Random Mode** lets you search through any of these platforms at random — making each search a surprise, and each click count in a different way.
